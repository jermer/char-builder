                        A certain well-known roleplaying game has seen a recent rise in popularity, sparking the curiosity
                        of many new players. It can be challenging, however, for a newcomer to find their bearings in a game
                        that has three core rulebooks comprising almost 1000 pages of content!
                    </p>

                        Even the very first task -- creating a character -- can feel daunting. Newer
                        players are
                        often overwhelmed by the number of options available.

                        Over the years I've tried to reduce this learning curve while still being true to the game. The
                        result is this online character building tool.

                        Superfans will undoubtedly have strong opinions about the decisions I've made in the
                        streamlining process. Nevertheless, I hope this tool might be helpful for some new players, and for
                        the GMs who want to support them!
